## Some basic info about botserver and how to communicate between clients.

Note: To use botserver commands you need to either host your own botserver locally or use a public one (I don't know of any public ones).
I am using this one: 
[DibraServer](https://github.com/GabrielPiM/DreamNavBotServer/tree/master). You can either download it from his page or build it yourself using visual studio.
Without that .exe running or knowing about a public server you won't be able to use anything botserver related at all.
